Experiment 4: Python program to understand the basics of Set

Aim:
To understand and implement the basics of set data structure in Python and perform different set operations such as adding elements, removing duplicates, union, intersection, difference, and counting elements.

Theory:
Set is an unordered collection of unique elements defined using curly braces { }.
Set does not allow duplicate values and does not support indexing.
add() → Adds an element to the set
remove() → Removes a specific element from the set
discard() → Removes an element without raising error
union() → Combines elements of two sets
intersection() → Gives common elements of sets
difference() → Gives elements present in one set but not in another
len() → Gives the count of elements in a set
sorted() → Sorts the set elements in increasing order
frozenset() → Creates an immutable set
Algorithm:

Initialization and Display:
Initialize a set with mixed or integer data types and display the set.

Duplicate Removal:
Convert a list containing duplicate values into a set to remove duplicates.

Adding and Removing Elements:
Add new elements using add() and remove elements using remove() and discard().

Set Operations:
Create two sets and perform union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations.

Statistical Operations:
Use built-in functions like len(), max(), min(), and sorted() on set elements.

Iteration and Counting:
Iterate through a set using a loop and count specific elements if required.
Conclusion:
With this experiment, we can understand how Python sets work, how duplicate data can be eliminated, and how set operations help in solving real-world problems efficiently.
